# likespro - competitive-template
A C++ template that likespro uses for competitions such as CodeForces, ICPC, etc.

The main goal of this template is to be very powerful and convenient.

The IDE where competitive-template is developing - Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition.

# How to use it
Just copy & paste content of "likespro.eth - UNIVERSAL/likespro.eth - UNIVERSAL.cpp" to your empty program. Or simply download repo and start coding in this project.

# Why project name in VS is "likespro.eth - UNIVERSAL"
This is because the file where likespro code all solutions is called so; template is extracted from the file with solutions.

# I want to view raw file with some tasks solutions
Raw file with no extracted solutions is in "tasks-solutions" branch. But I really wonder why do you need it...
